# Single-Inheritance-Using-Java
This repository contains Day 17 of my Java learning challenge, focusing on the concept of Single Inheritance in Java. It explains how one child class can inherit properties and methods from a single parent class using the extends keyword. A simple example is included to demonstrate method inheritance and code reuse.

# Topic: Single Inheritance in Java
 What is Inheritance?

Inheritance is a concept in Java where one class acquires the properties and methods of another class.
It helps in code reuse and makes programs easier to manage.

# What is Single Inheritance?

Single Inheritance means a child class inherits from only one parent class.

 One parent → One child

# Why Use Single Inheritance?

Reuses existing code

Reduces duplication
 
Improves readability

Makes programs easier to maintain

# Key Points
